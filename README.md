This project involves analyzing a hotel reservation dataset to uncover insights and trends related to customer bookings. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of key metrics. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

Key Features
Data Loading and Cleaning:
Importing the dataset and handling missing values.
Converting data types where necessary.
Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.
Distribution of booking patterns over time.
Analysis of cancellation rates, booking lead times, and customer demographics.
Correlation analysis between different features.

Visualization:
Time series plots to visualize booking trends.
Bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to show the distribution of various features.
Heatmaps to analyze correlations.
